The dataset used is a derivative of a dataset that can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance (authors being Paulo Cortez, University of Minho, Guimaraes, Portugal, http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez).

Code included here was created by me; it was meant to be a *very* simple perceptron testing tool during workshops, so I didn't follow any sensible coding principles while creating it. I don't think it will be useful to anyone outside the scope of the workshops.
